# House-Sales-Data-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing house sales data using data visualization techniques. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, initially in Excel format. The project involved data preprocessing to ensure data integrity followed by creating interactive visualizations using Tableau.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about house sales, including various attributes such as price, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Checked for missing values and data inconsistencies.
   - Ensured data quality by handling null values and other types of errors.

2. **Data Visualization with Tableau**:
   - Utilized Tableau to create an interactive House Sales Dashboard.
   - The dashboard included the following visualizations:

   - **Daily Average House Sales Price Line Chart**: Showcased the trend of average house sales prices over time.
   - **Map Visualization**: Displayed the geographical distribution of house sales.
   - **House Price Distribution Chart**: Illustrated the distribution of house prices.

   - **Bathrooms Distribution Chart**: Visualized the distribution of houses based on the number of bathrooms.
   - **View vs Condition Heatmap**: Depicted the relationship between the view and condition of houses based on their prices.

3. **Interactive Filters**:
   - Implemented various filters to enhance user interaction:
     - **Month Selector**: Allows users to filter data by selecting a specific month.
     - **Date Picker**: Enables users to filter data by selecting a date from the calendar.
     - **Sliders for Sq ft Living Area, Year Built, and Sq ft Lot**: Allows users to filter data based on these parameters.
